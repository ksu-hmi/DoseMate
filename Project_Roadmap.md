 # Findings 
[ Zainab ] https://github.com/ByrneThomas/Medication_-Reminder_-For_The-_Elderly/blob/main/Final%20code.py

 This Python script utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Medication Reminder App. It includes functions for loading medication data from a CSV file, displaying medication information, setting reminders based on specified schedules, and adding new medication schedules. The application also employs text-to-speech functionality to provide audio feedback to the user. However, there are areas for potential improvement. Error handling, input validation, and file handling should be more robust to ensure smooth operation. Additionally, enhancing the user interface and implementing security measures, if necessary, would further enhance the application's usability and reliability.
 
[ Anita  ] https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/appointment-reminders-flask

 A Python based application which used a Flask web framework and Celery distribution system to send SMS reminder about upcoming appointments. Before the app can be used you must first configure your account abd environment credidentals using the information found on your Twilio console. Once complete you can add appointments and set up when you would like to recieve your SMS remainder. Other features of this app include shortcode resources, fraud protection and video tutorials to help aid in making the application user friendly. As is, the app is quite efficient and designed to account for most common errors that are prone to happen.   
 
[Brianna] [https://github.com/thenoogler/med-reminder/blob/main/README.md]

This Python application using a Flask, PostgreSQL, and SQLAlchemy backend allows users to log and keep track of medications. Additionally, in your user profile it has the ability to display more information about the medications you are taking.
